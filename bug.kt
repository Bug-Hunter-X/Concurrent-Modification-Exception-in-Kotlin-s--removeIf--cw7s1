fun main() {
    val list = mutableListOf<Int>(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    list.removeIf { it % 2 == 0 }
    println(list)
}

//This code will produce an error because the removeIf function is modifying the list while it is iterating over it, which leads to unexpected behavior.  The `removeIf` function removes elements based on the provided predicate, which in this case is `it % 2 == 0`. This removes even numbers. However, when an element is removed, the iterator's internal state is affected, and the next element's index changes.

//This will not produce the expected result of [1,3,5] because of concurrent modification issues.
